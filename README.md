# WindowPositioner
A program for managing programs

# Reason
If you are like me you like to have very specific monitor setups. Sometimes it can be frusterating to set up these configurations of programs. This program automates opening software.

# Usage
1. To begin first create a new profile by clicking the "New" button on the first page
2. Enter a name for you profile and click "Add"
3. Select your new profile from the box and click "Edit"
4. Click "Add"
5. Click "Select Open"
6. A dialog will appear, in this dialog you can select a open program
7. Click "Add", then "Add" again
8. Finally click "Save"

Now you have created a new profile and added a program to it. You can click test to open the program at that location

# Future updates
I plan on allowing you to setup hotkeys to open profiles, also the fact that the select open programs dialog also displays hidden process is annoying, I would like it to only select visible windows
